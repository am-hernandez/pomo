# Pomo

Pomo is a Pomodoro timer in the browser.\
Use the Pomo timer to work through a long project or to remind yourself to take breaks every now and then!

## Usage

[Use the Pomo timer here](https://am-hernandez.github.io/pomo/) on github.\
Fill out the two fields:

1. **Session Length** - The length of each session before taking a short break.
2. **Number of Sessions** - The amount of sessions you'd like to assign.
3. **Start Timer** - Click this button to begin counting down your sessions.

A list of sessions will appear below the timer. Once a session has ended the corresponding session in the list will be removed automatically.

## Roadmap(work in progress)

This application is still being improved. Here's what's in the pipeline:

- play a sound when a session begins.
- remove breaks and sessions after timer has started.
- pause and resume timer during a session or break.
- name each session.
