# pomo (WIP) 

Pomo is a Pomodoro timer in the browser.\
Use the Pomo timer to work through a long project or to remind yourself to take breaks every now and then!

## Usage

[Use the Pomo timer here](https://am-hernandez.github.io/pomo/) on github.\
Fill out the two fields:
1. **Session Length** - The length of each session before taking a short break.
2. **Number of Sessions** - The amount of sessions you'd like to assign. 
3. **Start Timer** - Click this button to begin counting down your sessions.\

A list of sessions will appear below the timer. Once a session has ended the corresponding session in the list will be removed automatically.
